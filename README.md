# Tetris

Function oriented hack version of tetris in vanilla javasctipt (ES6 syntax).
I looked a few different implementations and found some techniques I liked
and then added my own ideas.

This is just a proof of concept. I would like to create a full clone
of the game, including more "bullpen" pieces (the original game shows
NEXT plus 3 future), and the ability to "hold" a piece. The best way
to get this done is to split up the code and make it more object oriented.

I would also like to improve the scoring (to match the original) and
create an API that stores high scores.
